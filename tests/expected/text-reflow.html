        Unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness. Wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast
        and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books, or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque,
        gigantic, and vine-encumbered trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft. Such a lot the gods gave to meâ€”to me, the
        dazed, the disappointed; the barren, the broken. And yet I am strangely content, and cling desperately to those sere memories, when
        my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other.

        I know not where I was born, save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible; full of dark passages and having high
        ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows. The stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp, and
        there was an accursed smell everywhere, as of the piled-up corpses of dead generations. It was never light, so that I used sometimes
        to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief; nor was there any sun outdoors, since the terrible trees grew high above the
        topmost accessible tower. There was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky, but that was partly
        ruined and could not be ascended save by a well-nigh impossible climb up the sheer wall, stone by stone.
